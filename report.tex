\section{Introduction}

This report describes our group's dynamic programing solution to a particular
algorithic problem: given a list of events occuring at times $1,\ldots,n$ find
a viewable subset of the events including the last event. The viewer starts at
time 0 and position 0 and has the choice to move at most 1 position for each
time step.

\section{Recursive Formulation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Let $\mathtt{evset}_p\{t\}$ denote the set containing only $t$ if an event
        at time $t$ occurs at coordinate $p$, otherwise the empty set.
    \item Let $n$ denote the number of events to occur.
    \item Let $c$ denote the coordinate of the last event.
    \item Let $P(t, x)$ be the predicate $n - t \ge |x - c|$.
\end{itemize}

Our recursive formulation for the maximum observable events subset, $m(t, p)$
where $t$ is the current time and $p$ is the current coordinate, is as
follows:

\begin{displaymath}
    m(t, p) = \mathtt{evset}_p\{t\}\, \cup\,
    \begin{cases}
        \emptyset & \text{if}\ t = n \\
        \text{max}_{\text{length}} \left\{m(t + 1, x) :
        x \in \left\{p - 1, p, p + 1\right\} | P(t, x)
        \right\} & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{displaymath}

Using the above recursive formula, the maximum observable events subset for the
problem presented is $m(0, 0)$.

As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:recursive}, this recursive formula can get
expensive. Up to 3 calls of $m$ may be required for each call of $m$ until the
base case is reached. Fortunately, the predicate $P(t, x)$ prevents making
calls for which a solution would be impossible.

    labels on the nodes show the position of the telescope.}

\subsection{Recurrence Relation}

It is easy to notice that subtrees in Figure~\ref{fig:recursive} will repeat
frequently in solving the problem. This is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:red};
the edges marked in red indicate subtrees which have already been computed and
an intermediate stored result can be used rather that recomputing the subtree.

    \caption{The same tree as in Figure~\ref{fig:recursive}. Red edges indicate the
    subtrees that the intermediate result can be stored.}

\subsection{Algorithmic Complexity}

At each level of the tree in Figure~\ref{fig:red} at a certain time $t$, there
are $2t + 1$ nodes (not taking into account that $P(t, x)$ will reduce this
amount). Once we take into account $P(t, x)$ reducing the amount of calls we
will make, we notice a similar pattern results. Letting $n$ be the number of
events to visit, there is exactly 1 call at $t = n$, 3 calls at $t = n -1$, 5
calls at $t = n - 2$, and so forth. This means that at a certain time $t$, the
number of nodes at that time will also be bounded by $2(n - t) + 1$. Putting
these two bounds together gives the formulation
\begin{displaymath}
    \sum_{i=0}^{\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil} (2i + 1) +
    \sum_{j=0}^{\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor} (2j + 1) = n^2
\end{displaymath}
as the number of nodes to visit. This leaves us with a worst-case algorithmic
complexity of $O(n^2)$.

\section{Implementation}
